<Tip>
  **IXO** offers an ecosystem of digital infrastructure, tools and services for you to create and control cognitive digital twins of real-world systems. 
  
  This is the new frontier of intelligent, decentralised, and autonomous:
  * Coordination
  * Financing
  * Verification
  * Governance
  * Data-gathering
  
  For sensing and responding to social, environmental, economic, and climate impacts, at an Internet-scale.
