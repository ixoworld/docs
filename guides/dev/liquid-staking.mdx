<Tip>
Liquid staking allows users to stake their tokens while maintaining liquidity through receipt tokens. This enables participation in network security while preserving the ability to transfer or use staked assets.
</Tip>

## Performing Liquid Staking

Stake your tokens and receive liquid staking tokens in return.

```typescript
const response = await MsgLiquidStake(
  "1000000uixo", // Amount to stake
  "staker_address" // Address of the staker
);
```

<Tip>
  When you liquid stake IXO tokens, you receive ZERO liquid staking tokens that represent your staked position. These tokens are used in the IXO Perpetual Carbon Offsetting Protocol.
</Tip>

## Performing Liquid Unstaking

Convert your liquid staking tokens back to the original tokens.

```typescript
const response = await MsgLiquidUnstake(
  "1000000uixo", // Amount to unstake
  "staker_address" // Address of the staker
);
```

<Accordion title="Unstaking Parameters">
  | Parameter | Type | Description |
  | --------- | ---- | ----------- |
  | `amount` | string | Amount of liquid tokens to unstake |
  | `staker` | string | Address of the staker performing the unstaking |
</Accordion>

## Governance and Administration

### Submitting Parameter Update Proposals

Create a governance proposal to update liquid staking parameters.

```typescript
const response = await MsgSubmitProposalUpdateLiquidStakeParams(
  "proposal_title", // Title of the proposal
  "proposal_description", // Description of the proposal
  "proposer_address" // Address of the proposer
);
```

### Managing Whitelisted Validators

Update the list of validators that can receive delegations from the liquid staking pool.

```typescript
const response = await MsgUpdateWhitelistedValidators(
  ["validator1_address", "validator2_address"], // List of validator addresses
  "admin_address" // Address of the admin
);
```

<Tip>
  Only whitelisted validators can receive delegations from the liquid staking module. This helps maintain security and reliability of the staking pool.
</Tip>
