<tip>
  Authorization (AuthZ) allows accounts to grant permissions to other accounts for executing specific types of transactions. This guide shows you how to implement common authorization scenarios.
</tip>

## Granting Send Authorization

Grant permission to another account to send tokens on your behalf.

```typescript
const response = await MsgGrantSend(
  "1000000uixo",     // Amount to authorize
  "granter_address", // Address granting permission
  "grantee_address"  // Address receiving permission
);
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --------- | ---- | ----------- |
| `amount` | string | Token amount and denomination to authorize |
| `granter` | string | Address granting the authorization |
| `grantee` | string | Address receiving the authorization |

## Executing IBC Send with Authorization

Send tokens through IBC channels using previously granted authorization.

```typescript
const response = await MsgExecSendIbc(
  "channel-0",       // IBC channel
  "grantee_address", // Address with authorization
  "1000000uixo"      // Amount to send
);
```

## Managing Fee Allowances

### Granting Fee Allowance

Authorize another account to use your tokens for transaction fees.

```typescript
const response = await MsgGrantAllowanceFeegrant(
  "granter_address", // Address granting allowance
  "grantee_address"  // Address receiving allowance
);
```

### Revoking Fee Allowance

Remove a previously granted fee allowance.

```typescript
const response = await MsgRevokeAllowance(
  "granter_address", // Address that granted allowance
  "grantee_address"  // Address to revoke from
);
```

## AuthZ Function Reference

### Core Functions

| Function | Description | Parameters |
| -------- | ----------- | ---------- |
| `MsgGrantSend` | Grants send authorization | `amount: string, granter: string, grantee: string` |
| `MsgExecSendIbc` | Executes IBC send with authorization | `channel: string, grantee: string, amount: string` |
| `MsgGrantAllowanceFeegrant` | Grants fee allowance | `granter: string, grantee: string` |
| `MsgRevokeAllowance` | Revokes a fee allowance | `granter: string, grantee: string` |
| `MsgExecAuthz` | Executes a transaction with granted authorization | *Varies by transaction type* |

## Troubleshooting

<Accordion title="Invalid Authorization Parameters">
  - Ensure addresses are correctly formatted
  - Verify the amount is within allowed limits
  - Check that the denomination is supported
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Execution Failures">
  - Confirm the authorization hasn't expired
  - Verify the grantee has sufficient permissions
  - Check that the authorization type matches the operation
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Fee Allowance Issues">
  - Ensure the granter has sufficient balance
  - Verify the allowance hasn't been exceeded
  - Check for any time-based restrictions
</Accordion>

<Tip>
  Authorizations can be time-limited. Monitor expiration dates and renewal requirements for critical permissions.
