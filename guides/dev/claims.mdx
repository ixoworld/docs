Claims and collections are central to managing interactions and transactions on the IXO blockchain. This guide shows you how to implement common claim operations.

## Creating a Collection

Set up a new collection for submitting and evaluating claims.

```typescript
const response = await CreateCollection(
  "entityDid1234",      // The DID of the entity creating the collection
  "protocolDid1234",    // The DID of the associated protocol
  "paymentsAccount1234" // Account to handle payments
);
```

| Parameter | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| `entityDid` | DID of the entity creating the collection |
| `protocolDid` | DID of the protocol under which the collection falls |
| `paymentsAccount` | Account to handle collection-related payments |
| `signer` | (Optional) Transaction signer |
| `cw20Address` | (Optional) CW20 token address for payments |

## Querying Collections

Retrieve collection data using the IXO Blocksync GraphQL API.

```graphql
query MyQuery {
  claimCollection(id: "99") {
    id
    startDate
    endDate
    entity
    protocol
    admin
    count
    evaluated
    approved
    rejected
    disputed
    claimSchemaTypesLoaded
    invalidated
    payments
    quota
    state
  }
}
```

<Tip>
  Replace the `id` field with your specific collection ID to get detailed information about that collection.
</Tip>

## Managing Claims

### Submitting a Claim

Submit a new claim to an existing collection.

```typescript
const response = await MsgExecAgentSubmit(
  "claimId1234",        // Unique identifier for the claim
  "collectionId1234",   // Identifier of the collection
  "adminAddress1234"    // Admin address authorizing the claim submission
);
```

### Evaluating a Claim

Assess and evaluate a submitted claim.

```typescript
const response = await MsgExecAgentEvaluate(
  "claimId1234",        // Unique identifier for the claim
  "collectionId1234",   // Identifier of the collection
  "adminAddress1234"    // Admin address authorizing the claim evaluation
);
```

## Querying Claims

Retrieve detailed information about claims using GraphQL.

```graphql
query MyQuery {
  claim(claimId: "bafkreihzugslzexyu2c6o6nmtm7vxbsyelo7pzmcppsmqawj2s6blmgojy") {
    schemaType
    claimId
    agentAddress
    agentDid
    collectionId
    paymentsStatus
    submissionDate
    evaluationByClaimId {
      status
      verificationProof
      amount
      evaluationDate
      oracle
      reason
    }
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

<Accordion title="Invalid Collection Parameters">
  - Ensure all DIDs and account addresses are correct
  - Verify payment account details are accurate
  - Check that the protocol DID exists and is valid
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Claim Submission Errors">
  - Check that the claim ID is unique and valid
  - Ensure the admin address has the necessary permissions
  - Verify the collection is in a state that accepts claims
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Evaluation Issues">
  - Confirm the claim is in a state ready for evaluation
  - Verify the evaluator has the correct authorization
  - Check that the collection is still active and valid
</Accordion>

<Tip>
  Always verify the status and details of claims and collections through the GraphQL API before performing operations on them.
