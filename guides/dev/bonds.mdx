<Tip>
  Bonds use mathematical bonding curves to determine token prices. The bond state affects which operations are allowed at any given time.
</Tip>

## Creating a Bond

Create a new financial instrument with specific parameters and bonding curve.

```typescript
const response = await CreateBond(
  true  // allowSells parameter determines if selling bonds is permitted
);
```

<Accordion title="Bond Parameters">
  | Parameter | Description |
  | --------- | ----------- |
  | `bondDid` | Unique identifier for the bond |
  | `token` | The bond's token denomination |
  | `name` | Name of the bond |
  | `description` | Description of the bond |
  | `functionType` | Type of bonding curve ("augmented_function" or "bonding_function") |
  | `functionParameters` | Array of parameters defining the bonding curve |
  | `reserveTokens` | Array of accepted reserve tokens |
  | `txFeePercentage` | Transaction fee percentage |
  | `exitFeePercentage` | Exit fee percentage |
  | `maxSupply` | Maximum supply of bond tokens |
  | `orderQuantityLimits` | Limits on order quantities |
  | `allowSells` | Whether selling of bonds is allowed |
  | `allowReserveWithdrawals` | Whether reserve withdrawals are allowed |
  | `alphaBond` | Whether this is an alpha bond |
  | `batchBlocks` | Number of blocks per batch |
</Accordion>

## Modifying Bond Parameters

Update an existing bond's configuration.

```typescript
const response = await EditBond();
```

<Tip>
  You can update parameters like name, description, order quantity limits, sanity rate, and sanity margin percentage.
</Tip>

## Managing Bond State

Change the lifecycle state of a bond.

```typescript
const response = await UpdateBondState(
  "OPEN"  // New state for the bond
);
```

| Available States | Description |
| ---------------- | ----------- |
| `HATCH` | Initial fundraising phase |
| `OPEN` | Active trading phase |
| `SETTLE` | Settlement phase |
| `FAILED` | Failed bond state |

## Trading Bonds

### Buying Bonds

Purchase bond tokens using reserve tokens.

```typescript
const response = await Buy(
  1000000,  // Amount of bonds to buy
  100       // Maximum price willing to pay
);
```

### Selling Bonds

Sell bond tokens back to the reserve pool (if allowed).

```typescript
const response = await Sell(
  1000000,  // Amount of bonds to sell
  100       // Minimum price willing to accept
);
```

## Managing Bond Outcomes

### Making Outcome Payments

Add funds to the outcome payment reserve.

```typescript
const response = await MakeOutcomePayment(
  1000000  // Amount for the outcome payment
);
```

### Withdrawing Funds

#### Withdraw Share

Claim your share of the bond's returns.

```typescript
const response = await WithdrawShare(
  WalletUsers.tester  // Signer of the transaction
);
```

#### Withdraw Reserve

Withdraw funds from the bond's reserve (if allowed).

```typescript
const response = await WithdrawReserve(
  WalletUsers.tester,  // Signer of the transaction
  1000000             // Amount to withdraw
);
```
