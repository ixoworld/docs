<Tip>
Smart accounts provide a robust and extensible framework for authenticating transactions on the IXO blockchain. Unlike traditional authentication methods, smart accounts allow you to use multiple types of authenticators, each with their own set of rules and conditions for transaction approval.
</Tip>

## Understanding Smart Accounts

<Accordion title="Smart Account Architecture">
  Smart accounts operate as a replacement for the default Cosmos SDK authentication mechanism through an ante handler (executed before transaction messages are processed). Key components include:
  
  - **Circuit Breaker**: Allows the module to be disabled if necessary
  - **Authenticator Selection**: Users opt-in to using authenticators for each message
  - **Authenticator Execution**: Multiple authenticators can be combined to create complex authentication logic
</Accordion>

<Tip>
  If no authenticators are selected, transactions default to the classic Cosmos SDK authentication method using standard signatures.
</Tip>

## Managing Authenticators

### Adding an Authenticator

Add a new authenticator to a smart account to enhance its security capabilities.

```typescript
const response = await MsgAddAuthenticator(
  "smart_account_address", // Address of the smart account
  "authenticator_address"  // Address of the authenticator
);
```

### Removing an Authenticator

Remove an authenticator from a smart account when it's no longer needed.

```typescript
const response = await MsgRemoveAuthenticator(
  "smart_account_address", // Address of the smart account
  "authenticator_address"  // Address of the authenticator
);
```

## Using Smart Accounts

### Sending Transactions with Authenticators

Execute a transaction that uses the smart account's authenticator for verification.

```typescript
const response = await MsgSendWithAuthenticator(
  "smart_account_address", // Address of the smart account
  "recipient_address",     // Address of the recipient
  "1000000uixo"            // Amount to send
);
```

## Composite Authenticators

Smart accounts support composite authenticators that combine multiple authentication methods for enhanced security and flexibility.

<Accordion title="Composite Authenticator Types">
  | Type | Description | Logic |
  | ---- | ----------- | ----- |
  | `AllOf` | Requires all sub-authenticators to approve | `authenticate(a) && authenticate(b) && ...` |
  | `AnyOf` | Requires at least one sub-authenticator to approve | `authenticate(a) || authenticate(b) || ...` |
</Accordion>

### Example Configurations

<Accordion title="One-Click Trading">
  ```
  AllOf(
    SignatureVerification(usersPubKey),
    AnyOf(
      MessageFilter(SwapMsg1),
      MessageFilter(SwapMsg2)
    ),
    CosmwasmAuthenticator(spendLimitContract, params)
  )
  ```
  This configuration allows a hot key to execute only swap messages and fails if the transaction would leave the user with a balance below a certain threshold.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Multi-signature">
  ```
  PartitionedAllOf(pubkey1, pubkey2, pubkey3)
  ```
  This creates a simple multi-signature scheme requiring signatures from multiple keys to authorize transactions.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Cosigner Protection">
  ```
  AllOf(
    SignatureVerification(cosignerPubKey),
    AnyOf(...user_authenticators)
  )
  ```
  This requires an off-chain cosigner service to approve all transactions, providing an additional layer of security.
</Accordion>

## Smart Account Function Reference

| Function | Description | Parameters |
| -------- | ----------- | ---------- |
| `MsgAddAuthenticator` | Adds an authenticator to a smart account | `smartAccount: string, authenticator: string` |
| `MsgRemoveAuthenticator` | Removes an authenticator from a smart account | `smartAccount: string, authenticator: string` |
| `MsgSendWithAuthenticator` | Sends a transaction using an authenticator | `smartAccount: string, recipient: string, amount: string` |

## Authentication Lifecycle

Smart account authentication follows a three-phase process to ensure security and flexibility:

<Accordion title="Authentication Phases">
  1. **Authenticate**: Verifies the transaction is authorized
  2. **Track**: Records any state changes required for authentication, committed regardless of transaction success
  3. **Confirm Execution**: Allows authenticators to validate the transaction's effects post-execution
</Accordion>

## Troubleshooting

<Accordion title="Invalid Authenticator Issues">
  - Ensure the smart account and authenticator addresses are correctly formatted
  - Verify the authenticator is authorized for the operation
  - Check that the authenticator ID is valid and exists on the account
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Transaction Failures">
  - Confirm the smart account has sufficient balance for the transaction and fees
  - Verify the recipient address is valid
  - Check that the authentication logic is correctly configured
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Composite Authenticator Problems">
  - Ensure all required signatures are provided for partitioned authenticators
  - Verify the composition logic matches your security requirements
  - Check that each sub-authenticator is correctly configured
</Accordion>

<Tip>
  Smart accounts are currently controlled by a "circuit breaker" parameter (`is_smart_account_active`). If this parameter is set to false, the module will not be used and transactions will fall back to classic Cosmos SDK authentication.
