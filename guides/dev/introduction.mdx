## Overview

The Implementation Guides provide practical instructions for integrating IXO SDKs and tools into your applications. These guides cover key functionalities like:

- Creating and managing entities
- Handling transactions 
- Interacting with IXO APIs
- Managing tokens and bonds
- Working with claims and collections

## Before You Begin

Make sure you have:

1. Installed the required [SDKs](../SDKs/SDKs-overview)
2. Set up the [Signing Client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ixo/impactxclient-sdk#signing-client) if using the IXO Spatial Web Multiclient SDK
3. Familiarized yourself with [IXO Blocksync GraphQL](blocksync-graphql-api-overview) for data queries

<Note>
The Signing Client is required for signing and broadcasting transactions when using the IXO Spatial Web Multiclient SDK.
</Note>

## Available Queries

### Entity Queries
Query entities and their associated identifiers through the Blocksync API.

```graphql
query GetEntity($id: String!) {
  entity(id: $id) {
    id
    type
    status
  }
}
```

### Data Queries
Access blockchain data including:

- Claims and Collections
- Tokens and Swaps  
- Bonds and Entities
- Chain Information
- Transaction History

## Module Guides

Each implementation guide follows a consistent format:

1. **Action Steps** - How to use IXO SDK functions with code examples
2. **Data Retrieval** - GraphQL queries to fetch relevant data
3. **Optional Updates** - Additional modifications and operations
4. **Reference** - Complete list of available module functions
