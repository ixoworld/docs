# IXO Matrix State Bot API

<Tip>
  The IXO Matrix State Bot API enables secure, decentralized storage and management of state events and access control lists (ACLs) within IXO Matrix Rooms.
</Tip>

## Overview

The IXO Matrix State Bot API is an open-source solution for managing state objects within the IXO Matrix ecosystem. By leveraging the Matrix protocol, this bot enables secure, decentralized storage and management of state events and access control lists (ACLs) for applications, projects, and communities.

## Key Features

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Custom State Event Management" icon="database">
    Define, store, and manage custom state events in IXO Matrix Rooms:
    - State Events (`ixo.room.state`): Room settings or configurations stored as JSON objects
    - ACL Events (`ixo.room.state.acl`): Access permissions for state events
    - Organized storage using unique keys (`state_key`)
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Flexible Access Control" icon="lock">
    Set granular access and edit permissions for room-specific state events:
    - Direct association between ACLs and state events
    - Role-based access control
    - Permission inheritance
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="REST API Integration" icon="code">
    Direct programmatic interface for state management:
    - Fetch and update state events
    - Manage ACLs
    - Configure bot access
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Matrix Commands" icon="message">
    In-room commands for state operations:
    - Intuitive command syntax
    - Real-time state management
    - Interactive responses

## REST API Integration

The RESTful interface offers a direct way to interact with the bot for managing state and ACL events. It simplifies backend integrations by providing endpoints for:

- Fetching and updating state events
- Managing ACLs
- Inviting the bot to rooms and configuring its access levels

## Matrix Commands

The bot supports Matrix room commands for managing state and ACL events within the IXO Matrix ecosystem. These commands offer a quick and intuitive way to perform state-related tasks directly in chat rooms.

## SDK Integration

The IXO Matrix State Bot can be easily integrated into your applications using the [IXO Matrix SDK](/spatial-web-stack/sdks/ixo-matrix-sdk):

```typescript
import { createMatrixStateBotClient } from "@ixo/matrixclient-sdk";

// Initialize IXO Matrix State Bot
const bot = await createMatrixStateBotClient({
  baseUrl: "https://matrix.ixo.world",
  accessToken: "BOT_TOKEN"
});

// Get room state
const state = await bot.getRoomState(roomId);

// Update state
await bot.setState(
  roomId,
  "custom.state.type",
  "",
  { key: "value" }
);
```
