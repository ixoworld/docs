## Types

### Message Filter Types

The following filter types are available for querying message-related data:

```graphql
"""
A filter to be used against many `Message` object types. All fields are combined with a logical 'and.'
"""
input TransactionToManyMessageFilter {
  """
  Every related `Message` matches the filter criteria. All fields are combined with a logical 'and.'
  """
  every: MessageFilter

  """
  Some related `Message` matches the filter criteria. All fields are combined with a logical 'and.'
  """
  some: MessageFilter

  """
  No related `Message` matches the filter criteria. All fields are combined with a logical 'and.'
  """
  none: MessageFilter
}

"""
A filter to be used against `BigFloat` fields.
"""
input BigFloatFilter {
  """
  Is null (if `true` is specified) or is not null (if `false` is specified).
  """
  isNull: Boolean

  """
  Equal to the specified value.
  """
  equalTo: BigFloat

  """
  Greater than the specified value.
  """
  greaterThan: BigFloat

  """
  Greater than or equal to the specified value.
  """
  greaterThanOrEqualTo: BigFloat

  """
  Less than the specified value.
  """
  lessThan: BigFloat

  """
  Less than or equal to the specified value.
  """
  lessThanOrEqualTo: BigFloat

  """
  Not equal to the specified value.
  """
  notEqualTo: BigFloat
}
```

## Using Filters

Filters can be combined to create complex queries. Here's how to use them:

### Message Filtering

Use the `TransactionToManyMessageFilter` to query transactions based on their associated messages:

```graphql
{
  transactions(
    filter: {
      messages: {
        some: {
          type: { equalTo: "send" }
        }
      }
    }
  ) {
    nodes {
      hash
      messages {
        type
        value
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Numeric Filtering

Use the `BigFloatFilter` for precise numeric comparisons:

```graphql
{
  transactions(
    filter: {
      amount: {
        greaterThan: "100.50"
      }
    }
  ) {
    nodes {
      hash
      amount
    }
  }
}
```

<Tip>
  All filter types support null checks and basic comparison operations. Combine multiple filters to create more specific queries.
