# IXO Blocksync GraphQL API Overview

The **IXO Blocksync GraphQL API** provides a comprehensive guide to querying transaction and state data of IXO Protocol blockchains. It enables developers to query blockchain data, filter information, and interact with IXO's decentralized features in a flexible, user-friendly manner.

## Purpose

Introduce developers to the key components of the IXO Blocksync GraphQL API, facilitating the building of applications that rely on GraphQL for seamless blockchain service access.

## Document Coverage

- **Scalars**: Custom scalar types like `BigFloat` for high-precision values.
- **Filters**: Input filters such as `BigFloatFilter` for logical data querying.
- **Types and Queries**: Core types and queries for data interaction.
- **Directives**: GraphQL directives like `@specifiedBy` for custom scalar behavior.

## Key Sections

### 1. Scalars and Directives

Defines custom scalar types like `BigFloat` for precision beyond typical floating-point values. The `@specifiedBy` directive adds metadata to scalars.

### 2. Filters

Includes input filters like `BigFloatFilter` for applying conditions when querying blockchain data.

### 3. Core Types

Defines types within the IXO blockchain, such as entities, bonds, and claims.

### 4. Queries

Provides access to blockchain features via queries. Note: No mutations are enabled; only queries are available.

## Benefits

- **High Precision Data Handling**: Custom scalars ensure accurate financial calculations.
- **Flexible Filtering**: Input filters allow complex logical conditions for data queries.
- **Seamless Data Interaction**: Intuitive queries support a wide range of use cases.

## Use Cases

- **Blockchain Data Queries**: Access information about bonds, claims, and entities.
- **High Precision Financial Operations**: Use scalars like `BigFloat` for token economics.
