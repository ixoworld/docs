# Spatial Web Orchestration

The IXO Spatial Web Orchestration system provides developers with tools and frameworks for managing secure computation and coordinating complex processes across distributed systems. This guide covers core concepts and implementation details.

For implementation examples and code, visit our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ixofoundation/orchestration/blob/main/README.md).

## Core Concepts

### Spatial Web Architecture

The IXO Spatial Web Stack combines several key technologies:
- Web 3.0 protocols
- AI systems integration
- Multi-dimensional mapping
- Digital Twin representations
- Cryptographic authentication using DIDs (Digital Identifiers)

Unlike traditional web architectures that rely on IP-based routing, the Spatial Web creates multi-dimensional domains where:
- Digital information maps directly to physical objects and locations
- Interactions occur through cryptographically authenticated DIDs
- Both tangible (physical) and intangible (cognitive) systems can be represented

### Orchestration System

The orchestration layer manages automated coordination between:
- Human agents
- Organisations
- IoT devices
- AI systems
- Blockchain networks

Key features:
- Secure computation across distributed systems
- Efficient service and data access
- Strict security protocol enforcement
- Object capability-based permission management

## Object Capabilities Implementation

Object capabilities form the security foundation of the orchestration system. They provide granular permission control for specific actions and resources.

### Key Benefits

1. **Granular Access Control**
```typescript
// Example of granular permission setting
const capability = {
  action: "read",
  resource: "sensor-data",
  constraints: {
    timeWindow: "24h",
    dataTypes: ["temperature", "humidity"]
  }
}
```

2. **Enhanced Security**
- Minimized attack vectors through capability restriction
- No exposure of unnecessary access rights

3. **Decentralized Trust**
- Capability-based verification
- No central authority requirement

## Implementation Guide

### Setting Up Object Capabilities

The orchestration system uses [Agoric Orchestration](https://docs.agoric.com/guides/orchestration/) and [zCaps](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/zcap-spec/) (Authorization Capabilities for Linked-Data) for secure interactions.

Implementation flow:

1. **Create Invitation**
```typescript
// Example invitation creation
const invitation = await createCapabilityInvitation({
  service: "dataAccess",
  permissions: ["read", "write"],
  constraints: {
    expiry: "24h"
  }
});
```

2. **Grant Capability**
```typescript
// Example capability granting
const grantedCap = await grantCapability({
  invitation,
  recipient: recipientDID,
  scope: ["read"]
});
```

3. **Execute & Monitor**
```typescript
// Example execution monitoring
const monitor = await setupCapabilityMonitor({
  capability: grantedCap,
  onViolation: (violation) => {
    console.log("Security violation detected:", violation);
    revokeCapability(grantedCap);
  }
});
```

4. **Manage Revocation**
```typescript
// Example revocation
const revoke = await revokeCapability({
  capabilityId: grantedCap.id,
  reason: "Security policy update"
});
```

## Use Cases

### 1. Smart City Integration

```typescript
// Example smart city device orchestration
const trafficSystem = await createOrchestration({
  type: "smartCity",
  devices: ["trafficLights", "sensors"],
  capabilities: {
    "trafficLights": ["status", "control"],
    "sensors": ["read"]
  }
});
```

### 2. DeFi Operations

```typescript
// Example DeFi orchestration
const defiOrchestration = await setupDeFiCapabilities({
  operations: ["swap", "stake"],
  chains: ["ethereum", "cosmos"],
  constraints: {
    maxAmount: "1000",
    timelock: "1h"
  }
});
```

### 3. Autonomous Systems

```typescript
// Example autonomous system coordination
const autonomousSystem = await createAutonomousOrchestration({
  type: "drone",
  capabilities: ["location", "status", "navigation"],
  securityLevel: "high"
});
```

## Best Practices

1. Always implement capability revocation mechanisms
2. Use fine-grained permissions instead of broad access grants
3. Implement monitoring for capability usage
4. Regular security audits of capability chains
5. Maintain capability lifecycle management
