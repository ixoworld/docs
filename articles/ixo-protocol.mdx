description: 'Understanding the foundational protocol for the Internet of Impact'
---

<Tip>
The IXO Protocol is an open-source framework that powers the "Internet of Impact" â€“ a Web3 network designed to measure, verify, and value real-world outcomes in a decentralized way. It enables the creation of verifiable claims about changes in the state of the world and transforms them into digital assets.
</Tip>

## Overview

The IXO Protocol provides a trustworthy, transparent set of standards for impact investing and sustainable development. By leveraging blockchain technology and building on open data standards, it bridges the trust gap in impact financing and verification, allowing stakeholders to fund and support projects with confidence that reported outcomes are real and independently verified.
