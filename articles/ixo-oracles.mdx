<Tip>
IXO Prediction Oracles are autonomous AI agents that provide intelligent services with decentralized identity, secure data storage, and blockchain integration. These oracles go beyond traditional data feeds by offering predictive and prescriptive capabilities that enable cognitive digital twins to anticipate future states and recommend optimal actions. By combining verifiable credentials with advanced analytics, IXO Oracles create trusted intelligence networks that can transform raw data into actionable insights across various domains.

## Types of Oracles

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Data Oracles" icon="database">
    Traditional oracles that serve as data pipelines, bridging off-chain data onto blockchain networks to tell smart contracts "what is true" about the world. These provide validated external information but don't foresee or influence future outcomes.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Prediction Oracles" icon="chart-line">
    Advanced agentic systems that leverage AI and data across the entire data maturity lifecycle. Unlike data oracles, they anticipate future outcomes and can prescribe or initiate actions to achieve desired results.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Analytics Maturity Stages

<Steps>
  <Step title="Ad Hoc & Reactive">
    Oracle acts on-demand, retrieving or publishing data only when called or when specific events trigger it. This establishes the foundation by collecting and validating raw data.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Descriptive Reporting">
    Oracle aggregates historical data to tell the story of what has happened. It produces reports or on-chain records of events, establishing a reliable source of truth.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Diagnostic Analysis">
    Beyond reporting events, the oracle analyzes causal factors and correlates data points to explain why something happened, providing deeper insights.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Predictive Analytics">
    Using machine learning and statistical models, the oracle forecasts future events or trends, delivering probabilistic predictions based on learned patterns.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Prescriptive Analytics">
    At the highest maturity level, the oracle suggests or initiates actions to shape future outcomes, functioning as an autonomous decision-maker.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Implementation Guide

### Oracle Configuration

```typescript
import { createOracle } from "@ixo/oracle-agent-sdk";

// Initialize oracle
const oracle = await createOracle({
  type: "VerificationOracle",
  model: "causal-inference-v1",
  confidence: 0.95,
  evidenceTypes: ["telemetry", "image", "location"]
});

// Configure verification rules
await oracle.setVerificationRules({
  requiredEvidence: ["deviceId", "timestamp", "location"],
  thresholds: {
    minimumConfidence: 0.9,
    maximumDeviation: 0.05
  },
  constraints: {
    timeWindow: "24h",
    locationPrecision: 6
  }
});
```

### Verification Flow

```typescript
// Create verification session
const session = await oracle.createVerification({
  subject: "did:ixo:entity/123",
  context: {
    location: {
      latitude: 51.5074,
      longitude: -0.1278,
      precision: 6
    },
    timestamp: Date.now()
  }
});

// Process data
const result = await session.verify(data, {
  evidence: supportingEvidence,
  rules: customRules
});

// Generate attestation
const attestation = await session.generateAttestation({
  result,
  method: "Ed25519Signature2020"
});
```

### Causal Analysis

```typescript
// Create causal model
const model = await oracle.createCausalModel({
  variables: ["intervention", "outcome", "context"],
  relationships: [
    { from: "intervention", to: "outcome" },
    { from: "context", to: "outcome" }
  ]
});

// Train model
await model.train(historicalData);

// Analyze causality
const analysis = await model.analyze({
  intervention: interventionData,
  outcome: outcomeData,
  context: contextData
});

// Generate insights
const insights = await model.generateInsights(analysis);

// Get prescriptive recommendations
const recommendations = await model.generateRecommendations({
  goal: "Increase outcome by 20%",
  constraints: {
    budget: 100000,
    timeframe: "3 months"
  }
});
```
