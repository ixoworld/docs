    The IXO Spatial Web implements a systems-thinking approach to capture relationships, feedback loops, and interdependencies in the real-world systems through which mitigation activities are coordinated, financed, verified, governed, and intelligently optimised.

## What are Cognitive Digital Twins?

Cognitive Digital Twins (CDTs) are digital replicas of real-world entities that possess cognitive capabilities – they can learn from data, adapt, and make intelligent decisions. The IXO Spatial Web platform implements CDTs through three core components:

1. **AI/ML Models for Cognition**: CDTs integrate artificial intelligence to simulate cognition. With runtime learning, a twin can analyze streaming data and update its behavior or predictions autonomously. On IXO, Oracle Twins serve this role – they are AI-powered agent services that evaluate data, perform verifications, and automate intelligent actions within the twin system.

2. **Federated Data Architecture**: CDTs draw from distributed data sources in a federated manner. IXO implements a "data matrix" layer of secure data nodes for each twin, allowing data to be shared across a network of stores rather than one silo. This federated design ensures scalability and resilience.

3. **Decentralized Identity Integration**: Every twin is anchored by a decentralized identity to establish trust and uniqueness. Each Digital Entity is identified by a W3C Decentralized Identifier (DID).

## Digital Entity Types

IXO distinguishes different types of twins in its architecture:

- **Physical Twins**: Correspond to real-world devices and sensors (e.g., IoT-enabled cooking stoves)
- **Cognitive Twins**: Model higher-level constructs like organizations, projects, or processes
- **Oracle Twins**: AI agents that provide analytical and decision-making capabilities
- **Twin Systems**: Capture the relationships and feedback loops between entities

## Digital Domain Properties

Each physical or conceptual element is represented as a _Digital Entity_ with a digital **Domain**. The domain infrastructure is implemented on blockchain with the following components:

### Domain Components
1. **Digital Identifier**  
   Created as a DID for verifiable ownership and uniqueness; can be enhanced with verifiable credentials.  

2. **Domain Controllers**  
   Defined by public keys or blockchain accounts. Only those with permission can update a domain's data.  

3. **Services**  
   Internet-based services tied to the domain, providing necessary functionalities (e.g., data ingestion endpoints).  

4. **Linked Resources**  
   Digital materials (documents, media) referenced via URIs, often with cryptographic proofs for authenticity.  

5. **Accorded Rights**  
   Object capabilities (zCAPs, Cacao) specify who can perform specific actions, preserving privacy and security.  

6. **Linked Claims**  
   Verified data items that update the domain's state (e.g., device usage records, fuel delivery confirmations).  

7. **Linked Entities**  
   Builds a network of related domains—such as funders, projects, or oracles—and formalizes their interconnections.  

8. **Economic Accounts**  
   Domains function as economic actors with blockchain accounts, enabling DeFi-related actions (e.g., staking, payments).  

9. **Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)**  
   Each domain is represented as an NFT, facilitating ownership transfers and interactions with other decentralized ecosystems.

### Data Security and Privacy

IXO implements a federated, end-to-end encrypted data architecture built on the Matrix protocol. Key features include:

- **Sovereign Data Stores**: Each digital twin domain has its own secure data store where structured data and real-time streams are recorded
- **End-to-End Encryption**: All data is protected with E2EE, ensuring only authorized agents can access the data
- **Interoperable Data Sharing**: Data can be securely shared across different servers and organizations while maintaining encryption
- **Decentralized Storage**: Integration with decentralized file storage networks like IPFS for larger files or public datasets

### Trust and Verification

Trust is established through:

1. **Verifiable Claims**: Digitally signed data or assertions produced by agents or devices
2. **Oracle Verification**: AI or human validators evaluate and verify claims
3. **Verifiable Credentials**: W3C-standard digital certificates that encapsulate verified claims
4. **End-to-End Trust Pipeline**: From data origin to verification and credential issuance

## Using Protocols

Manually configuring domains can be intricate, so the IXO platform offers _Protocols_ to streamline the process. A protocol is a predefined template of properties, relationships, and data models for a specific type of domain.

### Instantiating Protocols  
When developers create an entity from a protocol "class," it inherits the protocol's default configurations. These inherited settings can be forked and updated to fit the specific use case, promoting:  
- Rapid deployment of standard domain types
- Consistent data structures across projects
- Hierarchical organization, allowing child entities to trace back to a parent protocol

Example: Climate Mitigation Project Protocol  
A protocol designed for clean cooking initiatives can include:  
- Default data fields (fuel types, reporting standards, usage metrics)
- Relationships (verification oracles, project developers, funders)
- Services (data analytics, payment frameworks, governance tools)
