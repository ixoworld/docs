## Manage Spatial Web Domains
Each Cognitive Digital Twin has a Spatial Web Domain Identifier and a set of Domain Configurations.

## Domain Properties and Configuration

Domain properties are stored on-chain in the context of the IID Module as an entity document that resolves to a DID-Core standard Document, based on the Interchain Identifier (IID) DID Method. The associated domain metadata is maintained within the Entity Module.

### Access Control

Only the Controllers specified in the Domain Document have the authority to modify the Domain Configuration. Updates to entity document properties are performed by submitting a `msgUpdateEntity` transaction using the defined message structure.

### Class Inheritance

Every domain inherits from a Class, which is typically a Protocol Domain. This class is defined in the domain's context and links to the DID of the entity from which the class properties are inherited.

The complete domain document for an entity is compiled off-chain by aggregating:
- The domain's own properties
- Properties inherited from its class
- Properties inherited through multiple levels of class inheritance

<Note>
In cases where property conflicts exist between a domain and its inherited properties, the domain's own properties take precedence.
</Note>

This inheritance structure enables:
- Standardization through protocol domains
- Flexible property customization
- Multi-level inheritance for complex domain relationships
- Clear resolution of property conflicts
