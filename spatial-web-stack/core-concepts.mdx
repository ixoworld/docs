<Tip>
The IXO Spatial Web is a decentralized platform that enables the creation and management of cognitive digital twins for real-world systems, powered by blockchain networks, secure data storage, and AI oracles.
</Tip>

## Digital Twin Domains

Digital twins are verifiable digital representations of real-world entities and systems. The IXO Spatial Web implements different types of digital twins:
