The **SignX SDK** provides a secure and straightforward way for developers to integrate mobile-to-web authentication and transaction signing for IXO Protocol blockchains. It manages interactions between client applications, a mobile app, and a server, simplifying authentication, data handling, and multi-transaction processing.

## Key Features

### 1. Mobile-to-Web Authentication

- **QR Code Login**: Enables secure user authentication via QR codes.
- **Polling Mechanism**: Keeps the client application updated in near real-time during the login process.

### 2. Secure Data Handling

- **Encryption and Decryption**: Uses AES-256-CBC encryption for secure data transmission.
- **Data Flow Management**: Manages encrypted data exchange and processing.

### 3. Multi-Transaction Processing

- **Transaction Sessions**: Supports multiple transactions within a single session, enhancing security and user experience.
- **Long Polling Mechanism**: Provides real-time updates on transaction statuses.
