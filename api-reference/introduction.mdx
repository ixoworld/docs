The IXO Platform provides multiple APIs to interact with different components of the software services and data ecosystem. This guide covers the core APIs and how to get started using them.

## Available APIs

## Authentication

All API requests require authentication using API keys. Include your API key in the Authorization header:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

## Base URLs

Each API has its own base URL:

* PRC Gateway: [`https://rpc.ixo.earth`](https://rpc.ixo.earth/v1)

* gRPC Gateway: [`https://grpc.ixo.earth`](https://grpc.ixo.earth/v1)\`

* Blocksync GraphQL: [`https://graphql.ixo.earth`](https://graphql.ixo.earth/v1)

* Data Matrix Bot: [`https://matrix.ixo.earth`](https://matrix.ixo.earth/v1)

* Oracles: [`https://oracles.ixo.earth`](https://oracles.ixo.earth/v1)

## Response Format

Our APIs return responses in JSON format. A typical successful response looks like:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "result": "success"
  }
}
```

## Error Handling

The API uses conventional HTTP response codes:

* `2xx` - Success

* `4xx` - Client errors

* `5xx` - Server errors

Error responses include:

* Error code

* Human-readable message

* Request ID for support

## Rate Limiting

APIs are rate limited, depending on your plan and which API service you are using.

Rate limit headers are included in responses:

```bash:API Integration.md
X-RateLimit-Limit: 100
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 95
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1640995200
```
