<Tip>
  The IXO Spatial Web is a decentralized platform that enables you to create and manage cognitive digital twins of real-world systems, powered by blockchain networks, secure data storage, and Agentic Oracles.
</Tip>

<Note>
**Key Terminology**
- A **Digital Entity** is the foundational representation of any real-world actor or system in the IXO Spatial Web.
- A **Domain** is the on-chain identity record (DID Document) that anchors a Digital Entity, containing its verification methods, services, and properties.
- A **Digital Twin** is the complete functional system combining a Digital Entity, its Domain record, associated data, and operational logic.
</Note>

## Impact Hub Ecosystem

<Tip>
The Impact Hub Network is the public deployment of IXO Blockchain technology. While IXO Blockchain refers to the underlying technology and protocol stack, the Impact Hub Network is its primary public network implementation, serving as the main chain for impact verification, tokenization, and cross-chain coordination.
</Tip>

The Impact Hub Ecosystem consists of several integrated layers that work together to enable impact verification and management at scale:

<AccordionGroup>

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Development Stack" icon="code">
    Tools and interfaces for building on Impact Hub:
    - SDKs and APIs ([see Development Tools](#development-tools))
    - JAMBO developer platform for decentralized applications

    For implementation details, see our [Developer Guide](/guides/dev/overview).
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

Each component of the Impact Hub Ecosystem is designed to work seamlessly together while remaining modular. This allows developers to leverage specific components as needed for their use cases. For detailed documentation on each component, follow the links to their dedicated sections.
