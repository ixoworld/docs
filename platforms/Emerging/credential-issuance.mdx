<Tip>
  Verifiable credentials are tamper-proof digital attestations that enable secure, privacy-preserving verification of entities and their attributes in your cookstove projects without requiring continuous connectivity to the issuer.
</Tip>

## Product Overview

The Emerging platform's Credential Issuance system provides a standardized way to create, issue, and verify digital credentials for all entities in your cookstove projects. Built on W3C Verifiable Credentials standards and integrated with the Impact Hub public blockchain network, this system enables:

- **Tamper-Proof Attestations**: Issue cryptographically secure credentials that cannot be forged or altered
- **Privacy Preservation**: Control what information is shared and with whom
- **Offline Verification**: Validate credentials without requiring continuous connectivity to the issuer
- **Selective Disclosure**: Share only the necessary information for a specific verification
- **Revocation Management**: Update or revoke credentials when information changes or is no longer valid

This documentation explains how cookstove project implementers can interact with the platform to issue and manage credentials for all project participants and assets.

#### Using Protocol Domains:
1. Navigate to the "Protocols" section in the platform dashboard
2. Browse available Protocol Domains
3. Select the appropriate protocol for your credential type
4. Review schema requirements and verification rules
5. Use the protocol's schema when creating credentials

### Claim Submission and Evaluation

Before a credential can be issued, a claim must be submitted and evaluated:

#### Claim Submission Process:
1. Navigate to the "Claims" section in the platform dashboard
2. Select "Submit New Claim"
3. Choose the claim type based on the desired credential
4. Complete the required claim information
5. Attach supporting documentation
6. Sign and submit the claim

#### Using the API:
For programmatic claim submission, use the `msgSubmitClaim` function:

```json
{
  "claimId": "[Unique Claim Identifier]",
  "claimType": "[Claim Type]",
  "subjectDid": "did:ixo:entity:[subject-identifier]",
  "issuerDid": "did:ixo:entity:[issuer-identifier]",
  "content": {
    // Claim-specific content based on schema
  },
  "attachments": [
    {
      "id": "[Attachment ID]",
      "name": "Supporting Document",
      "contentType": "application/pdf",
      "data": "[Encrypted Data or IPFS Hash]"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Claim Evaluation:
Claims are evaluated through a combination of automated verification by Evaluation Oracle services and human review:

1. **Automated Verification**:
   - Schema validation
   - Required field checks
   - Cross-reference with existing data
   - Cryptographic signature verification

2. **Human Review** (when required):
   - Verification of supporting documentation
   - Compliance with standards and regulations
   - Additional checks based on credential type

3. **Evaluation Outcomes**:
   - Approved: Claim is verified and credential can be issued
   - Rejected: Claim does not meet requirements
   - Pending: Additional information or verification needed
   - Disputed: Claim is valid but requires additional review

### Credential Issuance

Once a claim is approved, a credential can be issued:

#### Issuance Process:
1. Navigate to the "Claims" section and find the approved claim
2. Select "Issue Credential"
3. Review the credential information
4. Sign the credential with the issuer's private key
5. Issue the credential to the subject

#### Using the API:
For programmatic credential issuance, use the `msgIssueCredential` function:

```json
{
  "credentialId": "[Unique Credential Identifier]",
  "credentialType": "[Credential Type]",
  "schemaId": "did:ixo:protocol:[schema-identifier]",
  "subjectDid": "did:ixo:entity:[subject-identifier]",
  "issuerDid": "did:ixo:entity:[issuer-identifier]",
  "issuanceDate": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "expirationDate": "2025-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "content": {
    // Credential-specific content based on schema
  },
  "proof": {
    "type": "Ed25519Signature2020",
    "created": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
    "verificationMethod": "did:ixo:entity:[issuer-identifier]#keys-1",
    "proofPurpose": "assertionMethod",
    "proofValue": "[Cryptographic Proof]"
  }
}
```

#### Success Response:
Upon successful issuance, you'll receive a response similar to:

```json
{
  "height": "123456",
  "txhash": "ABCDEF1234567890",
  "data": {
    "credentialId": "[Unique Credential Identifier]",
    "status": "Active"
  }
}
```

### Privacy-Preserving Storage

Credentials containing personally identifiable information (PII) are stored with end-to-end encryption:

#### IXO Matrix Data Rooms:
- Secure, encrypted storage spaces for sensitive credential data
- Controlled by Domain Controllers (credential issuers and subjects)
- Data is never stored unencrypted on the blockchain
- Access is granted through cryptographic authorization
- Servers may be hosted in-country to comply with local data protection laws

#### Storage Process:
1. PII is identified in the credential content
2. This data is encrypted using the subject's public key
3. Encrypted data is stored in the IXO Matrix data room
4. A reference to the encrypted data is included in the credential
5. The blockchain only stores a hash of the credential and its status

#### Access Control:
- Only authorized entities with the proper cryptographic keys can access the encrypted data
- The credential subject can grant or revoke access to specific verifiers
- Access can be time-limited or restricted to specific purposes

### Credential Verification

Verification allows third parties to confirm the authenticity and validity of credentials:

#### Verification Methods:
- **Direct Verification**: Verifier directly checks the credential against the blockchain
- **Intermediated Verification**: Verification through a trusted third-party service
- **Offline Verification**: Verification without requiring internet connectivity

#### Verification Process:
1. Verifier requests a credential from the holder
2. Holder presents the credential (full or selective disclosure)
3. Verifier checks:
   - Issuer's digital signature
   - Credential status on the blockchain (active, revoked, expired)
   - Schema compliance
   - Proof of subject control (holder proves they are the subject)

#### Using the API:
For programmatic verification, use the `verifyCredential` function:

```json
{
  "credentialId": "[Unique Credential Identifier]",
  "presentationContext": "[Verification Context]",
  "verifierDid": "did:ixo:entity:[verifier-identifier]"
}
```

### Credential Exchange

Credential exchange enables secure sharing of credentials between parties:

#### Exchange Methods:
- **Direct Exchange**: Peer-to-peer sharing between holder and verifier
- **Mediated Exchange**: Exchange through a trusted intermediary
- **Selective Disclosure**: Sharing only specific attributes from a credential

#### Exchange Process:
1. Verifier sends a credential request specifying required attributes
2. Holder reviews the request and consent requirements
3. Holder creates a Verifiable Presentation containing requested credentials
4. Holder sends the Verifiable Presentation to the verifier
5. Verifier validates the presentation and extracts the credential data

### Verifiable Presentation

Verifiable Presentations allow credential holders to combine multiple credentials and selectively disclose information:

#### Presentation Creation:
1. Navigate to the "Credentials" section in the platform dashboard
2. Select "Create Presentation"
3. Choose the credentials to include
4. Select which attributes to disclose from each credential
5. Sign the presentation with the holder's private key
6. Share the presentation with the verifier

#### Using the API:
For programmatic presentation creation, use the `createVerifiablePresentation` function:

```json
{
  "presentationId": "[Unique Presentation Identifier]",
  "holderDid": "did:ixo:entity:[holder-identifier]",
  "credentials": [
    {
      "credentialId": "[Credential Identifier]",
      "disclosedAttributes": ["attribute1", "attribute2"]
    }
  ],
  "audience": "did:ixo:entity:[verifier-identifier]",
  "expirationDate": "2024-02-01T00:00:00Z"
}
```
