Kitchen Performance Tests (KPTs) are field-based procedures that measure and validate real-world fuel consumption in household cooking environments through direct observation. These tests follow strict methodological requirements to ensure accurate quantification of emission reductions and prevent over-crediting.

## Methodological Requirements

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Test Design">
    * **Random Selection**: 
      - Households must be randomly selected
      - Selection methodology must be documented in MADD
      - Platform provides tools for random selection and documentation
    * **Test Groups**:
      - Reference group (old stove users)
      - Intervention group (new stove users)
      - Both groups must be tested simultaneously
      - Reference group must be representative of target population
    * **Participant Motivation**:
      - Clear strategy for engaging reference households
      - Documentation of incentive structures
      - Compliance monitoring tools
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Test Duration">
    * **Minimum Duration**: 3 days required
    * **Test Period Selection**:
      - Must capture representative cooking patterns
      - Documentation of test day determination
      - Justification of period appropriateness
    * **Timing Considerations**:
      - Seasonal cooking variations
      - Cultural factors affecting cooking habits
      - Local event calendars
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Data Collection Frequency">
    * **Climate Variations**:
      - Account for spatial and temporal climate differences
      - Track seasonal impacts on fuel consumption
    * **External Factors**:
      - Monitor traditional cooking patterns
      - Track occupational influences
      - Document cultural events
    * **Continuous Monitoring**:
      - Ongoing coverage is best practice
      - Any gaps require detailed justification
      - Regular data validation checks
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Sample Size Requirements">
    * **Population Coverage**:
      - Full population testing preferred
      - Sampling allowed with proper design
    * **Sample Determination**:
      - Follow [sampling design guidelines](/platforms/Emerging/sample-size)
      - Statistical significance requirements
      - Documentation of selection process
  </Accordion>

intervention_baseline = client.kpt.get_baseline("intervention-group")

# Compare with IoT readings
iot_data = client.devices.get_usage("device-456")
reduction = calculate_reduction(reference_baseline, intervention_baseline, iot_data)

# Validate seasonal factors
seasonal_impact = client.kpt.analyze_seasonal_variations(reduction)
