<Tip>
  Digital identifiers are the foundation of the Emerging platform's dMRV system, enabling secure, verifiable tracking of all entities in your cookstove projects without compromising privacy or data sovereignty.
</Tip>

## Product Overview

The Emerging platform's Digital Identifier system provides a standardized way to uniquely identify and authenticate all entities in your cookstove projects. Built on decentralized identifier (DID) technology through the Impact Hub public blockchain network, this system enables:

- **Unified Entity Registry**: Create globally unique identifiers for households, devices, projects, and distribution agents
- **Self-Sovereign Control**: Maintain full ownership and control of your identifiers without central authority
- **Verifiable Credentials**: Issue and verify claims about entities in your project ecosystem
- **Digital Twin Creation**: Generate blockchain-based digital representations (NFTs) of real-world entities
- **Secure Authentication**: Cryptographically verify the identity of entities interacting with your project

This documentation explains how cookstove project implementers can interact with the platform to generate and manage identifiers and credentials for all project participants and assets.

## Functional Requirements

### Unified Registry Identifiers (DIDs)

The Emerging platform implements standard, globally unique identifiers for all entities in the dMRV system. Decentralized identifiers (DIDs) are generated by the decentralized registry (Impact Hub public blockchain network) for each household, device, project, and agency.

#### Key Features:
- **Globally Unique**: Each DID follows the format `did:ixo:entity:[unique-identifier]`
- **Self-Sovereign**: DIDs are issued and controlled by the organization that creates them
- **Persistent**: DIDs remain valid for the lifetime of the entity they identify
- **Resolvable**: DIDs can be looked up to retrieve associated information
- **Verifiable**: DIDs enable cryptographic verification of associated claims

#### Digital Twin NFTs
When a DID is created, the IXO Protocol blockchain creates a Digital Twin NFT (non-fungible token) for each real-world entity. This means:
- Data, services, rights, accounts, and claims associated with the DID can be owned and controlled by the DID owner
- The cryptographic keys associated with a DID enable authentication by its controller
- Verifiable claims can be submitted, and verifiable credentials can be issued, using the identifier as the subject

### Registering an Entity

To register a DID using the platform, you can use either the web interface or the API:

#### Using the Web Interface:
1. Navigate to the "Registry" section in the platform dashboard
2. Select "Create New Entity"
3. Choose the entity type (Project, Household, Device, or Agent)
4. Complete the required metadata fields
5. Submit the registration request

The platform handles all blockchain interactions and covers transaction fees through your platform subscription.

#### Using the API:
For programmatic registration, use the `msgCreateEntity` function:

```json
{
  "id": "did:ixo:entity:[unique-identifier]",
  "type": "[EntityType]",
  "controller": "[ControllerDID]",
  "credentials": [],
  "metadata": {
    "startDate": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
    "endDate": null,
    "status": "Active"
  }
}
```

When using the API directly, a small transaction fee (gas) in IXO tokens is required to add this record to the blockchain.

#### Success Response:
Upon successful creation, you'll receive a response similar to:

```json
{
  "height": "123456",
  "txhash": "ABCDEF1234567890",
  "data": {
    "id": "did:ixo:entity:[unique-identifier]",
    "type": "[EntityType]",
    "status": "Active"
  }
}
```

### Entity Metadata

Each entity in the registry contains metadata that provides additional information and context:

#### Required Metadata:
- **Entity Type**: Specifies the category (Project, Household, Device, Agent)
- **Controller**: The DID of the entity that controls this identifier
- **Status**: Current state (Active, Inactive, Suspended)

#### Optional Metadata:
- **Validity Period**: Start and end dates for the entity's validity
- **Credentials**: Array of credential identifiers associated with the entity
- **Location**: Geographic coordinates (for physical entities)
- **Custom Properties**: Additional fields specific to the entity type

### Verified Status

The entity metadata includes a verified status (True or False) which may only be set by the Market Relayer account of the platform operator.

#### Verification Process:
1. Entity is registered with initial verified status set to False
2. Platform operator (Market Relayer) reviews the entity according to established criteria
3. If approved, the Platform Operator sets verified status to True
4. Verified status is visible in entity queries and can be used by applications

The criteria and process for verifying entities, as well as the governance procedures, are determined by the Platform Operator, which typically operates as a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO).

### Editing an Entity's Domain Record

The entity domain record (DID Document) can only be modified by a Controller account:

#### Using the Web Interface:
1. Navigate to the entity details page
2. Select "Edit Entity"
3. Modify the desired fields
4. Submit the update request

#### Using the API:
To update an entity's domain record, use the `msgEditEntity` function:

```json
{
  "id": "did:ixo:entity:[unique-identifier]",
  "controller": "[ControllerDID]",
  "metadata": {
    "status": "Inactive"
  }
}
```

Only the fields included in the request will be updated; omitted fields remain unchanged.

### Entity Accounts

Each Digital Twin Domain entity has one or more accounts that may hold digital assets:

#### Key Features:
- **Asset Ownership**: Entity accounts can hold tokens, NFTs, and other digital assets
- **Delegated Control**: Entity owner can authorize other accounts to operate the entity accounts
- **Granular Permissions**: Controls can be set for spend amounts, token types, and time periods
- **Ownership Transfer**: When entity ownership is transferred, all assets move with the entity

#### Adding an Entity Account:
To add a new entity account, use the `msgCreateEntityAccount` function:

```json
{
  "entityId": "did:ixo:entity:[unique-identifier]",
  "name": "Operating Account",
  "accountType": "token",
  "permissions": [
    {
      "delegateDid": "did:ixo:entity:[delegate-id]",
      "maxTokens": "1000",
      "denominations": ["uxio"],
      "validUntil": "2025-01-01T00:00:00Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Adding or Removing Entity Controllers

Entity controllers have full authority to manage the entity's domain record and accounts:

#### Adding a Controller:
1. Navigate to the entity details page
2. Select "Manage Controllers"
3. Add the DID of the new controller
4. Specify controller permissions
5. Submit the update

#### Removing a Controller:
1. Navigate to the entity details page
2. Select "Manage Controllers"
3. Select the controller to remove
4. Confirm the removal
5. Submit the update

Note that an entity must always have at least one controller.
A controller may include a Group Account, which may have governance rights over the entity.

### Transferring Domain Ownership

To transfer ownership of an entity to another controller:

#### Using the Web Interface:
1. Navigate to the entity details page
2. Select "Transfer Ownership"
3. Enter the DID of the new owner
4. Confirm the transfer
5. Sign and submit the request

#### Using the API:
Use the `msgTransferEntity` function:

```json
{
  "id": "did:ixo:entity:[unique-identifier]",
  "fromDid": "did:ixo:entity:[current-owner]",
  "toDid": "did:ixo:entity:[new-owner]"
}
```

Upon successful transfer, all entity accounts and assets are transferred to the new owner.

### Authenticating an Entity

Authentication verifies that an interaction is authorized by the entity controller:

#### Authentication Methods:
- **Key-based**: Using the cryptographic keys associated with the controller
- **Credential-based**: Using verifiable credentials issued to the entity
- **Multi-factor**: Combining multiple authentication methods for higher security

#### Authentication Process:
1. Client application requests authentication from entity
2. Entity provides authentication proof using one of the registered methods
3. Platform verifies the proof against the entity's domain record
4. If valid, the authentication is confirmed and access is granted

## Non-functional Requirements
