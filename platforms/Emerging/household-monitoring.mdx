<Tip>
Household monitoring enables granular tracking of clean cooking adoption through digital twins, IoT integration, and AI-powered verification. Since emission reductions are directly linked to household fuel consumption, usage rates, and installed stove numbers, the monitoring system ensures reliable and accurate measurement of these critical factors.

## Digital Twin Setup

<CodeGroup>
```json Household Model
{
  "did": "did:ixo:household/123",
  "type": "CleanCookingHousehold",
  "location": {
    "district": "XYZ",
    "density": "Medium"
  },
  "devices": [{
    "did": "did:ixo:device/456", 
    "type": "ElectricPressureCooker",
    "status": "active"
  }],
  "baseline": {
    "fuelType": "Charcoal",
    "monthlyConsumption": 40
  }
}
```

```python Create Household
from emerging import Household, Device

household = Household.create(
    location={
        "district": "XYZ",
        "density": "Medium"
    },
    baseline={
        "fuel_type": "Charcoal", 
        "monthly_consumption": 40
    }
)

device = Device.get("did:ixo:device/456")
household.add_device(device)
```

## API Integration

### Household Management

```bash
# Create household
curl -X POST https://api.emerging.eco/v1/households \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "location": {
      "district": "XYZ",
      "density": "Medium"
    },
    "baseline": {
      "fuelType": "Charcoal",
      "monthlyConsumption": 40
    }
  }'
```

### Impact Analysis

```bash
# Analyze household impact
curl -X POST https://api.emerging.eco/v1/analysis/household \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "householdId": "did:ixo:household/123",
    "periodStart": "2024-01-01",
    "periodEnd": "2024-01-31"
  }'
```
