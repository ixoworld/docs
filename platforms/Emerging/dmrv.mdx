<Tip>
  The Emerging Household Energy provides a decentralized digital Measurement, Reporting, and Verification (dMRV) system that delivers real-time data capture, robust protocol configuration, and cryptographic verification for climate impact activities.
</Tip>

## Overview

The [Emerging Household Energy](https://emerging.eco) implements [IXO](https://ixo.world) dMRV protocols for managing clean cooking data and generating Internationally Transferred Mitigation Outcomes (ITMOs). The system provides:

- **Household-Level Reporting** - Consolidated data across multiple devices and fuel sources
- **Usage Monitoring** - Tracking of multiple devices and fuels to prevent double-counting
- **Connected Data Graph** - Linked entities and claims for system-wide insights  
- **Immutable Records** - Blockchain-backed registry for full traceability

## Core Concepts

### Digital Entities

Digital Entities are online representations of real-world objects or concepts in the IXO Spatial Web, including:

- Physical entities (stoves, energy devices)
- Cognitive entities (organizations, projects, assets)

Each entity has a W3C DID (Decentralized Identifier) that provides:
- Unique identification
- Cryptographic verification
- Self-sovereign control

### Entity Relationships

Entities form nodes in a data graph connected by relationships that show:

- Project implementation by organizations
- Project funding sources
- Asset generation
- Claim verification by Oracles
- Credential issuance
- Impact credit tokenization

### Domain Registration

Entities register on the blockchain as domains with:

- DID for verifiable ownership
- Domain controllers (authorized updaters)
- Connected services
- Linked resources and claims
- Object capabilities (zCAPs, Cacao)
- Economic accounts
- NFT representation

### Protocols

Protocols provide templates for domain configuration including:

- Default data fields
- Standard relationships
- Required services
- Governance settings

## Emission Reduction Quantification

The accurate quantification of emission reductions in clean cooking initiatives depends on three critical factors:

1. **Household Fuel Consumption**: Precise measurement of fuel usage patterns and quantities
2. **Usage Rate**: Actual utilization rates of clean cooking devices
3. **Installation Base**: Accurate tracking of number and type of stoves installed

### Real-Time Field Data

Emission reductions must be verifiable and quantifiable to be recognized under international standards. The dMRV system ensures this through:

- **Continuous Data Collection**: Real-time field data provides the foundation for credible quantification
- **Immediate Verification**: Automated validation of incoming data streams
- **Temporal Accuracy**: No retroactive data collection or post-hoc estimations
- **Field-to-Registry Pipeline**: Direct flow from measurement to verification to registration

### Monitoring Requirements

To ensure reliable quantification, the dMRV system implements:

- **Comprehensive Monitoring Plans**: Structured data collection across all key metrics
- **Statistical Rigor**: Sample design and size calculations that meet methodology requirements
- **Data Quality Controls**: Validation of fuel consumption and usage measurements
- **Installation Tracking**: Verified device registration and deployment records

These elements are essential for:
- Accurate emission reduction calculations
- Reliable baseline establishment
- Verifiable impact claims
- Methodology compliance
