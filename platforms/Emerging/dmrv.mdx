description: 'Learn how to implement IXO decentralized Monitoring, Reporting and Verification (dMRV) for clean cooking initiatives and ITMO generation'
---

## Overview

The [Emerging Platform](https://emerging.eco) implements [IXO](https://ixo.world) dMRV protocols for managing clean cooking data and generating Internationally Transferred Mitigation Outcomes (ITMOs). The system provides:

- **Household-Level Reporting** - Consolidated data across multiple devices and fuel sources
- **Usage Monitoring** - Tracking of multiple devices and fuels to prevent double-counting
- **Connected Data Graph** - Linked entities and claims for system-wide insights  
- **Immutable Records** - Blockchain-backed registry for full traceability

## Core Concepts

### Digital Entities

Digital Entities are online representations of real-world objects or concepts in the IXO Spatial Web, including:

- Physical entities (stoves, energy devices)
- Cognitive entities (organizations, projects, assets)

Each entity has a W3C DID (Decentralized Identifier) that provides:
- Unique identification
- Cryptographic verification
- Self-sovereign control

### Entity Relationships

Entities form nodes in a data graph connected by relationships that show:

- Project implementation by organizations
- Project funding sources
- Asset generation
- Claim verification by Oracles
- Credential issuance
- Impact credit tokenization

### Domain Registration

Entities register on the blockchain as domains with:

- DID for verifiable ownership
- Domain controllers (authorized updaters)
- Connected services
- Linked resources and claims
- Object capabilities (zCAPs, Cacao)
- Economic accounts
- NFT representation

### Protocols

Protocols provide templates for domain configuration including:

- Default data fields
- Standard relationships
- Required services
- Governance settings

## Benefits

- Real-time tracking of system dynamics
- Immutable, verifiable records
- Simplified entity management through protocols
- Automated workflows and verification
- Evidence-based oversight for Article 6.2 compliance
