The Emerging Household Energy uses decentralized Measurement, Reporting, and Verification (dMRV) to track SDG indicators through:

- Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) for entities
- Verifiable claims and credentials
- Oracle-based validation
- Ex-post and ex-ante data collection

## Core Components

### Entity DIDs
Each participant (household, business, project) has a unique DID that links to their claims and credentials.

### Claims & Credentials
- **Claims**: Data records about an entity (e.g., fuel purchases, survey responses)
- **Credentials**: Verified claims that are cryptographically signed and stored on the ledger

### Oracles
Validation agents that verify claims using:
- External APIs
- Sensor data
- Survey forms
- Partner databases

### Data Collection Methods
- **Ex-Ante**: Baseline data collected before intervention
- **Ex-Post**: Follow-up data collected at defined intervals

## SDG Implementation Guide

### SDG 1: No Poverty
**Indicator**: Annual household fuel cost savings

<Tip>
Requires tracking baseline vs. current fuel expenditure through validated purchase claims
</Tip>

**Data Flow**:
1. Register household DID
2. Record fuel purchase claims
3. Oracle validates payments
4. Issue savings credentials

### SDG 7: Clean Energy Access
**Indicator**: Modern cooking device adoption rate

**Data Flow**:
1. Log fuel purchase claims
2. Calculate usage thresholds
3. Validate through oracles
4. Generate adoption credentials

### SDG 13: Climate Action
**Indicator**: GHG emission reductions

**Data Flow**:
1. Collect device usage data
2. Validate emission calculations
3. Issue ITMO credentials
4. Maintain audit trail

## Security

The platform ensures data integrity through:
- Cryptographic signatures on all claims
- Immutable ledger records
- Role-based access control
- Privacy-preserving data handling
