## Privacy and Trust Framework

The registry operates as a Digital Public Good through a public blockchain infrastructure with the following key features:

- **Self-Sovereign Digital Identifiers**: Entities maintain full control over their identifiers
- **Privacy-Preserving**: No Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is stored on the blockchain
- **Distributed Network**: Globally-distributed independent Validator Node operators
- **Independent Verification**: Authentication of all claims and mitigation activity data

## Developer Integration

The registry provides APIs and tools for building applications that:

- Track and verify mitigation activities in real-time
- Manage tokenized credit lifecycles
- Enhance Article 6 activity transparency
- Scale impact solutions

The [registry server](/platforms/Emerging/registry-server) provides a REST API for interfacing with the registry and for integrations with other registry systems, such as National Carbon Registries.
