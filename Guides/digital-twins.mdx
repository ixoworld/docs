<Note>
  The IXO Spatial Web platform uses a systems-thinking approach where each physical or conceptual component is represented as a Digital Entity with its own Domain. Clean cooking systems serve as a practical example throughout this guide.

## Twin Types

<CardGroup>
  <Card title="Physical Twins" icon="microchip">
    Digital representations of physical devices and sensors (e.g., cooking stoves, IoT monitors, and tracked inventory)
  </Card>

  <Card title="Cognitive Twins" icon="brain">
    Digital models of organizational structures (e.g., projects, funders, distribution agents)
  </Card>

  <Card title="Twin Systems" icon="diagram-project">
    Digital representation of the networks of relationships and interactions between real-world entities
  </Card>

## Entity Structure

<CodeGroup>
  ```json Entity Example
  {
    "did": "did:ixo:entity/device-123",
    "type": "Device",
    "controller": "did:ixo:org/operator",
    "services": [{
      "id": "#data",
      "type": "DataIngestion",
      "endpoint": "https://api.emerging.eco/ingest"
    }],
    "verifiableCredential": [{
      "type": "Certification",
      "issuer": "did:ixo:org/certifier"
    }]
  }
  ```

  ```python Example: Clean Cooking Device
  from emerging import Entity

  # Create a specific device entity
  device = Entity.create(
      type="CleanCookingDevice",  # Specific implementation
      controller="did:ixo:org/project-dev",
      services=[{
          "id": "#data",
          "type": "DataIngestion",
          "endpoint": "https://api.emerging.eco/ingest"
      }]
  )
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Domain Properties

<ResponseField name="did" type="string" required>
  W3C Decentralized Identifier for unique entity identification
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="controller" type="string" required>
  Entity with update permissions
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="services" type="array">
  Associated services and endpoints
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="verifiableCredential" type="array">
  Issued certificates and proofs
</ResponseField>

## Entity Relationships

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Generic Implementation">
    * Organizations implement Projects

    * Projects generate Assets

    * Assets produce Claims

    * Oracles verify Claims

    * Claims become Credentials
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Example: Clean Cooking">
    * Project developer implements cooking program

    * Program generates stove installations

    * Stoves produce usage data

    * Oracles verify emission reductions

    * Verified data becomes carbon credits
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Using Protocols

<Note>
  Protocols are templates that define standard properties and relationships for specific entity types. They can be customized for any domain.
</Note>

### Protocol Structure

```json
{
  "type": "Protocol",
  "properties": {
    "metricOne": "string",
    "metricTwo": "number",
    "measurements": "object"
  },
  "relationships": {
    "verifier": "OracleEntity",
    "operator": "OrganizationEntity"
  }
}
```

### Instantiating Entities

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash Generic Creation
  curl -X POST https://api.emerging.eco/v1/entities \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
    -d '{
      "type": "Device",
      "protocol": "did:ixo:protocol/template",
      "properties": {
        "metricOne": "value",
        "metricTwo": 100
      }
    }'
  ```

  ```python Clean Cooking Example
  from emerging import Protocol

  # Example using clean cooking protocol
  protocol = Protocol.get("did:ixo:protocol/clean-cooking")
  stove = protocol.create_entity(
      type="CleanCookingDevice",
      properties={
          "fuel_type": "electric",
          "efficiency": 85
      }
  )
  ```
